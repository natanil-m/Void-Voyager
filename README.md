# Void Voyager

Welcome to Void Voyager, an exhilarating space adventure where you take on the role of an intrepid space explorer aboard a state-of-the-art spaceship. Your mission is to navigate through the vast reaches of space, avoiding obstacles, collecting valuable resources, and surviving the perils of the cosmos.

## Objective

Your primary goal is to collect the precious Cosmic Crystals, shining yellow beacons scattered throughout space. These crystals are vital for advancing your journey and scoring points.

## Hazards

Be cautious of the menacing Asteroid Belts that drift aimlessly through space. Colliding with these rocky obstacles will deplete your spaceship's health. You start with three lives represented by heart icons.

## Health Repair

Fear not, brave adventurer! Along your journey, you'll encounter special Galactic Repairs, glowing green entities that can repair your spaceship's health. Collect these repairs strategically to replenish your life force.

## Black Hole Threat

The cosmos is not without its challenges. A formidable Black Hole looms at the center of the galaxy, exerting gravitational forces that attract both danger and opportunity. Steer clear of its pull to avoid being drawn into its inescapable grasp.

## Game Over

Your mission comes to an end if your spaceship's health reaches zero. However, if you manage to accumulate a high score by collecting Cosmic Crystals and successfully navigate through the hazards of space, you might etch your name in the cosmic leaderboard.

## Controls

- Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to steer your spaceship.
- Press the SPACEBAR to activate your spaceship's thrusters for a burst of speed.
